# JSON Selenium Runner

JSON Selenium Runner is a flexible and powerful test automation framework that allows you to define and execute Selenium WebDriver tests using JSON configuration files without writing any Java code.

## Project Overview

This project provides a declarative approach to web test automation. Instead of writing Selenium code directly, you define your test scenarios as JSON files specifying what actions to perform and what elements to interact with. The framework handles all the WebDriver management, execution flow, waiting mechanisms, and reporting.

### Key Features

- **JSON-based test definition**: Write test scenarios in JSON format without coding
- **Rich set of actions**: Supports 30+ different actions for comprehensive web testing
- **Conditional execution**: Execute steps based on conditions
- **Detailed reporting**: Generates HTML reports with screenshots and execution details
- **Reusable steps**: Create complex test flows with repeatable steps
- **Cross-browser support**: Works with different browsers via WebDriverManager
